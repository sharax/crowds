I joined this project almost a month late because of my lack of awarness. When I found out I contacted Rajan Vaish Sir 

who was more than willing to accomodate me.I could not contribute to the earlier assignments so I studied past literatures 

submitted by my fellow students and, mainly the read the book "The Wisdom of crowds" by James Surowiecki.Brainstormed implementation 

of wisdom of crowds in two areas, "Amazon Price Prediction" and "Country Population" along with my team members.Prepared the list of 

items of interest (on Amazon) and enumarated a list of them for prediction for the former. Our team was selected amongst the top 5 teams for this assignment. 

Helped my teammated propose a research question on "To identify intelligent sub crowds from larger crowds and to compare their performance with the crowds as whole".

Did the data anaylis assignemnts using R programming language. Also Peergraded a few assignments.
